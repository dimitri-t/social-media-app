## A social media app clone

I built this app to get more comfortable using ReactJS by using it with a more advanced framework, implement a NoSQL database, learn about state management and learn how to create a full responsive app

Technologies used and implemented in this build:

- NextJS as the React Framework
- Firebase to store posts, comments and likes
- NextAuth so users can have full authentication using Google
- Recoil to manage state
- TailwindCSS and HeroIcons to create a beautiful responsive app

There are still a few things to work on and a few bugs to fix!!

To run the project simply run the following commands:

- git clone https://github.com/dimitri-t/social-media-app.git
- npm i
- npm run dev

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser
